# This library is for parsing dice notation. It is mostly based on the notation given at
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice_notation.
# This will accept 'Ã—'' for "multiply end result X times", but it is usually easier to use *
# 'x' will mean "perform combination X times"

# Accepts "standard" notation

# Accepts these alternative notations
# XzY for "zero-bias" notation (0-X rather than 1-X)
# XdF for "fudge" notation (alternatively, XdF.1 or XdF.2, for 1+,1-,4blank and 2+,2-,2blank respectively. Default is .2)
# XhY as standard, but only take highest
# XlY as standard, but only take lowest
# XiY as standard, but drop lowest
# Xd% for percentage, equivalent to Xd100

# Accepts these addenda for standard and zero-bias:
#  eX -- successes of X or greater
#  rX -- successes of X or greater, with die max re-rolled and added to same die (leave out X to just get highest result)
#  fX -- successes of X or greater, minus 1s
#  mX -- successes of X or greater, with die max re-rolled to see if it adds another success
